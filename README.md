**To Do List By MagiTech**</br>
To do list marks as our second project where we used Node and Express.</br>
To do list uses modules such as Express and Body-parser.</br>
Here using body-parser and grabbing hold of the input by the user, we save the value inside an array which is then rendered using express back to our ejs file.</br>
In our Ejs file we loop through the rendered array and update it in our file which is to be shown to the user.</br>
> As our second project using Backend, it's not much but we hope that you will appreciate it and provide any valuable guidance.
